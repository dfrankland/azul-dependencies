*xmlparser* is a low-level, pull-based, zero-allocation
[XML 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) parser.

## Example

```rust
for token in xmlparser::Tokenizer::from("<tagname name='value'/>") {
    println!("{:?}", token);
}
```

## Why a new library

The main idea of this library is to provide a fast, low-level and complete XML parser.

Unlike other XML parsers, this one can return tokens not with `&str`/`&[u8]` data, but
with `StrSpan` objects, which contain a position of the data in the original document.
Which can be very useful if you want to post-process tokens even more and want to return
errors with a meaningful position.

So, this is basically an XML parser framework that can be used to write parsers for XML-based formats,
like SVG and to construct a DOM.

At the time of writing the only option was `quick-xml` (v0.10), which does not support DTD and
token positions.

If you are looking for a more high-level solution - checkout
[roxmltree](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/roxmltree).

## Benefits

- All tokens contain `StrSpan` objects which contain a position of the data in the original document.
- Good error processing. All error types contain position (line:column) where it occurred.
- No heap allocations.
- No dependencies.
- Tiny. ~1500 LOC and ~35KiB in the release build according to the `cargo-bloat`.

## Limitations

- Currently, only ENTITY objects are parsed from the DOCTYPE. Other ignored.
- No tree structure validation. So an XML like `<root><child></root></child>`
  will be parsed without errors. You should check for this manually.
  On the other hand `<a/><a/>` will lead to an error.
- Duplicated attributes is not an error. So an XML like `<item a="v1" a="v2"/>`
  will be parsed without errors. You should check for this manually.
- UTF-8 only.

## Safety

- The library must not panic. Any panic considered as a critical bug
  and should be reported.
- The library forbids the unsafe code.
